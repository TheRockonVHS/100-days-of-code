**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

## Log

### Day 1: March 5 , 2023

**Today's Progress**: I was working on learning some more information on Event Handlers in JS. I spent a good amount of time on it today.

**Thoughts**: I got confused a little bit but I'm ready to practice more on it and do a couple small projects to reinforce my learning.
