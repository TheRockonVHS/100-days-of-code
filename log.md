**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 1: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I started the Complete Web Developer in 2021 course from Zero to Mastery. I went over the basic HTML5 tags. I also did a quick over of the span and div tags and how the span tag is for inline and the div tag is for blocks of code. It's used for CSS. I knew all of them already but it's a nice refresher.

**Thoughts:** So far it's been a refresher over things, I've learned years ago.

### Day 2: May 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the basic HTML tags and moved into the form tags. There are a lot of them! I used to use form tags quite often but that was like 10 years ago.

**Thoughts:** I felt pretty good going over all the basic and form tags. I should try to stay coding before 10 PM because I am getting pretty tired.

### Day 3: May 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I finished the HTML section in the course that I'm following. I then made a very basic website where I used all the things I just learned for some more practice. I then started a just a little bit of CSS. I went over the selectors, properties, and values.

**Thoughts:** I learned a little bit and it was nice to get some more coding time in. CSS is pretty cool!
